### **_Description_**

#### Welcome to "Meet Your Maker", a platform that recognizes and celebrates the unsung hobbyists, doers, creators and makers of the world.  Looking for someone to build you a dining room table? Bake a cake for your birthday party? Fabricate and 3D print a custom part for your motorcycle? Meet Your Maker will connect you with local talent to help you accomplish your task. The site is multi-focuesed, serving as a directory for hireable local talent that would otherwise have little to no exposure, a meeting place for like-minded creatives, and a buisness platform where jobs can be commissioned.

### **_Technologies_**

This app will be built using MERN stack technologies:
-MongoDB for hosting user and maker data
-Express/Node as the web framework/server by which we connect our front and backends
-React to power the front end web UI
