### **_Description_**

#### Welcome to "Meet Your Maker" - a platform that recognizes and celebrates the unsung hobbyists, doers, creators and makers of the world. Curious about the talent that lives in your neighborhood?   Looking for someone to build you a dining room table? Bake a cake for your birthday party? Fabricate and 3D print a custom part for your motorcycle?  Meet Your Maker will connect you with local doers to help you accomplish your task.  The site is multi-focuesed, serving as a directory for local talent that would otherwise have little to no exposure, a place to view their impressive skills, and in the long term, a platform where jobs can be commissioned.
