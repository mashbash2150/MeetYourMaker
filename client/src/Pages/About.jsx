        <p>Welcome to "Meet Your Maker" - a platform that recognizes and celebrates the unsung hobbyists, doers, creators and makers of the world.  </p>
        <p>Curious about the talent that lives in your neighborhood?   Looking for someone to build you a dining room table? Bake a cake for your birthday party? Fabricate and 3D print a custom part for your motorcycle? <br></br> Meet Your Maker will connect you with local doers to help you accomplish your task. </p>
        <p>The site is multi-focuesed, serving as a directory for local talent that would otherwise have little to no exposure, a meeting place for like-minded creatives, and (post-MVP) a buisness platform where jobs can be commissioned.  </p>
